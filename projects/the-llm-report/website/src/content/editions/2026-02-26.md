## OpenAI Launches GPT-5.4 With 300,000-Token Context Window, Cuts API Prices

*The new model, available immediately, triples the context capacity of its predecessor while reducing API costs by 20 percent across the board.*

OpenAI on Thursday released GPT-5.4, a new large language model featuring a 300,000-token context window and a 20 percent reduction in API pricing, according to the company's blog. The model is available immediately through the OpenAI API, the company said, marking a significant expansion in the volume of text that developers can process in a single prompt. The extended context window and lower price point arrive as competition among frontier model providers intensifies around both capability and cost.

The 300,000-token context window represents a substantial increase in the amount of input the model can handle at once, according to OpenAI. At that scale, developers could in principle feed entire codebases, lengthy legal contracts, or book-length documents into a single API call without needing to chunk or summarize the material beforehand. OpenAI did not immediately disclose detailed benchmark results comparing GPT-5.4 to its predecessors or to competing models on long-context tasks.

The 20 percent price reduction applies to API access, according to the company's blog post. OpenAI did not specify whether the cut applies uniformly to both input and output tokens or varies by tier, and the company did not provide exact per-token pricing figures in its initial announcement. The reduction nonetheless signals a continued downward trend in inference costs that has characterized the market over the past year as providers compete for developer adoption.

The model is available immediately through the OpenAI API, according to OpenAI, meaning developers and enterprises can begin integrating GPT-5.4 into existing workflows without a waitlist or staged rollout. The company has not yet indicated whether GPT-5.4 will be made available through ChatGPT or other consumer-facing products at a later date.

**Analysis:** The 300,000-token context window places GPT-5.4 squarely in competition with Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini, both of which have pushed aggressively into long-context territory in recent months. Anthropic's Claude 3.5 models support a 200,000-token window, while certain Gemini configurations have advertised context lengths exceeding one million tokens, though real-world performance at those extremes has varied. GPT-5.4's entry at 300,000 tokens may not match the largest advertised windows, but it could prove competitive depending on how well the model retains accuracy and coherence across the full span of its context, a metric that raw token counts alone do not capture.

The 20 percent price cut could have meaningful downstream effects for startups and enterprises building agentic or retrieval-augmented generation workflows on the OpenAI API. Lower per-call costs may make it more feasible to run multi-step agent loops or to pass large retrieved document sets directly into the model rather than relying on aggressive pre-filtering. For cost-sensitive production deployments, the reduction could shift build-versus-buy calculations, potentially drawing developers who had migrated to open-weight alternatives back toward OpenAI's hosted offering. However, the actual impact will depend on the specific per-token rates, which OpenAI has not yet detailed, and on whether competing providers respond with their own pricing adjustments in the near term.

*Shorter takes on other notable developments.*

### OpenClaw Adds Kilocode Provider, Vercel Claude Shorthand in v2026.2.23

OpenClaw on Sunday published version 2026.2.23 of its open-source AI gateway framework, adding first-class support for the Kilocode provider through Kilo Gateway and introducing Claude shorthand model references for the Vercel AI Gateway, according to the project's GitHub release notes. The update sets `kilocode/anthropic/claude-opus-4.6` as the default model for the new Kilocode provider and includes authentication, onboarding flows, and implicit provider detection. The release also ships new prompt-caching documentation and optional HTTP security headers for the gateway layer.

### OpenClaw 2026.2.24 Adds Multilingual Stop Phrases, Android Onboarding

OpenClaw released version 2026.2.24 of its open-source AI coding agent, according to the project's GitHub release notes. The update expands the tool's auto-reply and abort stop-phrase system with multilingual support covering Spanish, French, Chinese, Hindi, Arabic, Japanese, German, Portuguese, and Russian. The same release delivers a native Android onboarding flow and a redesigned post-onboarding interface built around a five-tab navigation shell. PR #25103, which covers the stop-phrase expansion, lists contributors @steipete and @vincentkoc, according to the project's GitHub repository.
