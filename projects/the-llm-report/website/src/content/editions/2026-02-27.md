## OpenClaw v2026.2.26 Adds External Secrets Management, ACP Agent Runtimes

*The release introduces a dedicated secrets workflow and promotes ACP agents to first-class thread-session runtimes with new CLI routing commands.*

OpenClaw on Wednesday published version 2026.2.26 of its open-source platform, adding an External Secrets Management workflow and elevating ACP agents to first-class runtimes within thread sessions, according to the project's GitHub release notes. The stable release, which follows a beta preview tagged v2026.2.26-beta.1, ships a full set of secrets lifecycle commands alongside new CLI tooling for agent route management. The secrets feature was contributed by developer @joshavant in pull request #26155, while the ACP thread-bound agents work was contributed by @osolmaz in pull request #23580, according to the release changelog.

The External Secrets Management feature centers on a new `openclaw secrets` command group that exposes four subcommands: `audit`, `configure`, `apply`, and `reload`, according to the release notes. Together, these commands provide a workflow for inspecting, setting up, deploying, and refreshing secrets at runtime. Supporting capabilities include runtime snapshot activation, which allows secrets state to be captured and applied during execution, as well as strict target-path validation and what the project describes as safer migration scrubbing. The feature also introduces ref-only auth-profile support, enabling authentication profiles to reference externally stored credentials rather than embedding them directly.

On the agent orchestration side, the release makes ACP agents first-class runtimes for thread sessions, according to the project's notes. This means ACP agents now integrate with spawn and send dispatch mechanisms, gain lifecycle controls, and support coalesced thread replies — a pattern that batches multiple agent responses within a single thread context.

A new Agents/Routing CLI accompanies the agent changes, adding `openclaw agents bindings`, `openclaw agents bind`, and `openclaw agents unbind` commands for account-scoped route management, according to the stable release notes. The beta release notes referenced these commands but provided only a truncated description, making the stable release the sole complete source for the routing CLI details.

The beta tag, v2026.2.26-beta.1, previewed the same core feature set before the stable cut, suggesting a relatively short stabilization cycle between the two tags.
