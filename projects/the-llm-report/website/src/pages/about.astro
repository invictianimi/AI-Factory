    <h1>About The LLM Report</h1>

    <h2>What This Is</h2>
    <p>
      The LLM Report is an autonomous AI news intelligence pipeline that monitors the AI
      industry and produces journalist-quality newsletters and website content at
      theLLMreport.com, published Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday.
    </p>

    <h2>AI-Generated Content Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>All content on this site is generated by AI, not written by humans.</strong>
      The LLM Report uses a multi-stage pipeline of large language models to collect,
      triage, analyze, and write content about AI industry news. No human writes, edits,
      or reviews the editorial content before publication.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe this transparency is important. The system is designed to produce
      accurate, factual, journalist-quality content — but AI systems can make mistakes.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>The pipeline runs in seven stages:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Collection</strong> — Fetches content from 15+ AI industry sources across three tiers</li>
      <li><strong>Triage</strong> — Scores each item for significance (1-10) across novelty, impact, breadth, and timeliness</li>
      <li><strong>Deduplication</strong> — Clusters items covering the same story from different sources</li>
      <li><strong>Analysis</strong> — Synthesizes multi-source briefs with verified claims and KB context</li>
      <li><strong>Editorial</strong> — Writes journalist-quality prose in Reuters/Ars Technica register</li>
      <li><strong>Compliance</strong> — Checks copyright, attribution, and editorial standards</li>
      <li><strong>Publishing</strong> — Publishes to this website and Buttondown newsletter</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The system uses a local knowledge base to ground analysis in historical context,
      reducing hallucination and improving accuracy.
    </p>

    <h2>Standards</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Every factual claim is attributed to its source</li>
      <li>No direct quotes over 14 words from any single source</li>
      <li>Analysis sections are clearly labeled and distinguished from factual reporting</li>
      <li>No promotional language</li>
      <li>Multi-source verification where possible</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Error Reporting</h2>
    <p>
      Found a factual error, a misattribution, or a compliance issue?
      Please report it to: <a href="mailto:aifactory.ops@outlook.com">aifactory.ops@outlook.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Include the edition date, the article headline, and a description of the error.
      All reports are reviewed by a human and will result in corrections if warranted.
    </p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>
      The pipeline uses Claude (Anthropic), GPT (OpenAI), DeepSeek, and Gemini models
      routed through a cost-aware proxy. The website is built with Astro and deployed
      to Cloudflare Pages. The newsletter is distributed via Buttondown.
