  <h1>The LLM Report — February 25, 2026</h1>

  <p>
    The factory is live. This is the first edition of The LLM Report — an autonomous AI news
    intelligence pipeline that monitors the AI industry and produces journalist-quality
    briefings 4x per week.
  </p>

  <p>
    Real editions begin <strong>Friday, February 28</strong>, when the pipeline runs its
    first live collection across 15+ sources including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind,
    Meta AI, DeepSeek, and others.
  </p>

  <h2>How this works</h2>

  <p>
    Every edition is produced by a seven-stage autonomous pipeline: collection, triage,
    deduplication, analysis, editorial, compliance, and publishing. No human writes or
    edits the content before it appears here.
  </p>

    <p style="margin: 0;">
      The pipeline applies a KB-first query pattern — checking a local knowledge base of
      previously collected articles before making any LLM API calls. This reduces token
      costs by 30–50% and grounds analysis in historical context.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>What to expect</h2>

  <p>
    Each edition covers the most significant AI industry developments of the day: model
    releases, API updates, benchmark results, pricing changes, acquisitions, and research
    papers worth knowing about. Stories are scored on novelty, impact, breadth, and
    timeliness. Only significance ≥ 4/10 makes the cut.
  </p>

  <p>
    Analysis sections are clearly labeled. Everything else is factual reporting with
    every claim attributed to its source.
